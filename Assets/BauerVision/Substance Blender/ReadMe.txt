If this is your first time using Substances, the material icon you see is NOT the material that you will drop onto your models.

Notice the small arrow icon attached to the material? Click that to open the substance.

The first slot is the material that you will drop onto your models. The other items show you the textures that currently have been generated.

------------------------

Inside of BauerVision/Substance Blender, you will find folders containing a single channel substance maker as well as the 6 multi-channel substance maker.
These folders are simply initial setups for your future substance library. Since its so easy to just duplicate these materials to make new ones, I set them
up with the suffix ( _001 ) so your duplications can go on for quite a while.

You will also find the Textures folder which contain the 10 source textures this package ships with for you to get started creating right away.

Using it

---------------------

MultiChannel Substance


First populate each of the 6 empty texture slots with some of your texture goodness. You don't have to use all 6, but they are there if the need arises.

Seasonal/Effect: These are the main controls you'll use to add water, snow, ice and moss to your material.

Channel 2 - Growth: Each channel contains:

    Mix Position:  This slide controls the mask blending of one channel over the other. A zero value is no inclusion of the channel. 1 = full inclusion.
    
    Mix Contrast:  Provided to help tweak the blending. Zero basically is a weak blend and a 1 is strong, crisp blend of the mask.
    
    Invert Height: This option inverts the incoming height map. Basically if your channel is blending onto the high parts of the channel beneath it, this will
                   make the channel appear in the low areas. 
    
    Switch Mix:    The blend is either driven solely from the mask, or with the help of procedural noise. A value of 0 means total mask, 1 = totally procedural.
                   Use this is you see that the height map based blending isn't quite spreading enough across the surface. Procedural noise will help reach more areas.
    
    Channel Transform matrix: All you need to remember is X and W are the values that control the tiling. Y and Z tilt the texture.

    AO:   This just gives you a little tweaking to the Ambient Occlusion. Lower values on Position is darker, higher = lighter.

    Base Channel options:   These are pretty obvious. The only one worth mentioning is the Roughness Levels Out / Low - High. This is where you can control wetness of the surface.

    Seasonal/Effect: These are just the rest of the tweak available for the snow, water, ice and moss.

    Generated textures:  Options worth playing with is the Metallic channel, set it from Smoothness (A) to Metallic (A) for more metal surfaces.

    Target Width / Height:  Once you are happy with your material, set it to your desired resolution. I'd recommend leaving it at 512 while your designing. :)
